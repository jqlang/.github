# Introduction

This is the jqlang organization.  We're hoping that Stephen Dolan will take notice and approve of it and our intent to host two repositories in this org:
 - jqlang/spec -- a specification for the jq programming language
 - jqlang/jq -- a new canonical source for the C implementation of jq that is currently at https://github.com/stedolan/jq/
 
 # Motivation
 
  - WikiPedia deleted the page for the jq language because "it looks like a personal project".  No amount of arguing with the editor helped.
  
  - Stephen Dolan has been too busy to look after jq.
  
  - The remaining maintainers, Nicolas Williams and William Langford have been too busy as well, and William has indicated that he will no longer act as a maintainer.  We would like to recruit new maintainers.
  
  - Maintainers need sufficient access to be able to set up GitHub Actions, other CIs, etc., and to add maintainers/committers.
  
  - A specification for the jq language arguably belongs in a separate repository.
