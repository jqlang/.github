# Introduction

This is the jqlang organization.
<!--
 - [jqlang/spec](https://github.com/jqlang/spec) -- a specification for the jq programming language
-->
 - [jqlang/jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) -- the canonical source for the C implementation of jq (transfered from https://github.com/stedolan/jq/)
 
 # Motivation

  - Stephen Dolan has been too busy to look after jq.
  - The remaining maintainers, Nicolas Williams and William Langford have been too busy as well, and William has indicated that he will no longer act as a maintainer.  We have recruited new maintainers.  
  - Maintainers need sufficient access to be able to set up GitHub Actions, other CIs, etc., and to add maintainers/committers.
  - A specification for the jq language arguably belongs in a separate repository.
    - tentatively jqlang/spec, although this does not exist as of 2023-June-4.
  - Wikipedia deleted the page for the jq language because "it looks like a personal project".  No amount of arguing with the editor helped.
